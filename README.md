**Heart Health and Lifestyle Prediction Analysis**

This repository contains an analysis and predictive modeling study focused on heart health and lifestyle choices using a comprehensive dataset of 8,763 records from patients worldwide. The goal is to predict the risk of heart attacks based on various features.

**Dataset**

The dataset includes:
Patient-specific details: Age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, diabetes, family history, smoking habits, obesity, alcohol consumption.
Lifestyle factors: Exercise hours, dietary habits, stress levels, sedentary hours.
Medical aspects: Previous heart problems, medication usage, triglyceride levels.
Socioeconomic aspects: Income, country, continent, hemisphere.

The dataset ends with a binary classification feature

**Models Used**
The following machine learning models were implemented for prediction:
• Random Forest Classifier
• Gradient Boosting Classifier

Despite the variety of features in the dataset, the models achieved limited success due to low correlation between the features with correlation values around 0.00, 0.01 and -0.01.
